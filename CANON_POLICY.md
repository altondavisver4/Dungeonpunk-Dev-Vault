# Canon Policy

**Goal:** Ensure assistants answer from **ACTIVE** doctrine by default. Archived/Deprecated content is ignored unless the user says **"include archive"**.

## Categories
- **ACTIVE** — current, authoritative design.
- **DEPRECATED** — replaced; for history only.
- **ARCHIVED** — retired/experimental; history only.

## Assistant Rules
1) Default scope: **ACTIVE only**.
2) If a query mentions an archived/deprecated concept (e.g., legacy terms):
   - Prefer the replacement listed in the Canon Map.
   - If none exists, say: “That concept is archived. Current doctrine is …” and cite the active doc.
3) Only include archived content if the user writes **"include archive"**.
