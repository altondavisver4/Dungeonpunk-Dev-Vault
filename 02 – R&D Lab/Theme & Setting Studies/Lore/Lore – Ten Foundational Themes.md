# Ten Foundational Themes

These ten themes define the core tone, structure, and narrative weight of the setting. They are meant to inform all future lore, mechanics, and procedural design choices.

## 1. Post-apocalyptic
The world is broken. Survival is difficult, and ruins are more common than functioning infrastructure. Factions and individuals alike scrape by in a world far from its former glory.

## 2. Brutal
Life is violent and short. Power is taken, not given, and mercy is often punished. Every interaction carries risk, and weakness invites predation.

## 3. Technology as Wonder of the Past
The relics of the old world are rare and revered. Even a functioning tool can shift the balance of power. Machines are treated with awe, and those who can repair them are valued as high priests.

## 4. Sorcery as Force of Dread
Magic is feared, not celebrated. It is unpredictable, corrupting, and dangerous to all who encounter it. Sorcerers are hunted, enslaved, or worshiped as omens of doom.

## 5. Civilization is Decadent
What passes for civilization is rotting from within. Leaders indulge in excess while the masses suffer. Corruption, exploitation, and cruelty fester behind guarded walls.

## 6. Xenophobia is Widespread
Trust is rare. Communities cling to insular identities and treat outsiders as threats. Prejudice shapes every encounter, making travel as dangerous socially as it is physically.

## 7. Knowledge is Lost
True understanding is as rare as clean water. Most skills are forgotten, and even common crafts may be mysteries. Those who guard knowledge hold power beyond weapons.

## 8. The Unknown Surrounds Everything
The world beyond known borders is unmapped and dangerous. Myths and superstition fill the gaps where facts are absent, and the wilderness itself feels alive with threat.

## 9. Heroes are Rare
True champions are anomalies. Acts of selflessness are met with suspicion, and those who rise above the norm are targeted before they can change much.

## 10. The Dark is Calling
A vast, unseen force — whether magical, cosmic, or psychological — draws the world toward ruin. Some resist, others embrace, but none can fully ignore its pull.
