# Narrative Doctrine: Political Powder Keg Adventures (Conan d20 2E)

### Core Premise
Adventures take place in regions already primed for conflict. The player is not the origin of tension but the catalyst: their arrival destabilizes an existing powder keg.  

---

### 1. Regional Political Powder Keg
- Regions are defined by **factions in active or imminent conflict**.  
- The player’s intervention acts as a disruptive element — not a savior, not a conqueror by default.  
- Each faction has **goals, grievances, and fault lines** waiting to rupture.  
- Resolution isn’t about peace, but about **shifting the balance** in ways that create both opportunity and consequence for the player.  

---

### 2. Companions as Co-Stars (Bioware Old School Lens)
- Companions are **characters first, mechanics second**.  
- They hold opinions on political factions and player decisions, sometimes arguing mid-scene.  
- Loyalty, grudges, or moral stance can shift outcomes of negotiations, betrayals, or alliances.  
- They can leave, rebel, or defect — they are not guaranteed permanent assets.  

---

### 3. Tone (Saint’s Row 2 → Sword & Sorcery Filter)
- **Personal melodrama:** betrayal, revenge, and intimate loss drive plots.  
- **Swagger and indulgence:** excess, bravado, and vice prevent the tone from sinking into sterile politics.  
- Stakes are both **tragic and thrilling** — think bloody Conan sagas where survival, freedom, and pride outweigh grand ideals.

### 4. Narrative Loop (Ōkoku e Tsuzuku Michi)
- **Conquest → Indulgence → Consequence**  
  - Victory leads to indulgence (luxury, pride, overconfidence).  
  - Indulgence breeds weakness or vulnerability.  
  - Consequences strike back: betrayal, enemy resurgence, natural disaster, or internal decay.  
- The cycle provides **escalation without requiring “save the world” arcs**.  

---

### 5. Companion Gameplay (Alpha Protocol–Inspired Missions)
- Companions may **split off during adventures** to pursue parallel objectives.  
- Player must decide:  
  - Allow the companion to pursue their goal (which may alter faction dynamics, loot, or outcomes).  
  - Keep them close for security but sacrifice opportunities.  
- Outcomes affect both **narrative loyalty** and **faction relations**, not just tactical resources.  

---

### Combined Narrative Structure
- **Setting:** A powder keg of clashing factions, each a possible ally or enemy.  
- **Tone:** Tragic melodrama paired with indulgent bravado.  
- **Loop:** Every victory sets up indulgence, which in turn sets up future consequences.  
- **Companions:** Dramatic co-stars who argue, defect, and act on their own agendas.  
- **Gameplay:** Adventures structured around faction conflict, with companions creating branching mission paths and political consequences.

### Guiding Principle
**The player is never the sole axis of the world.**  
They are a disruptive presence in a living conflict, with companions and factions acting as forces of their own. Victory always contains the seeds of the next downfall, keeping tension constant and narrative alive.
