# Theme Compile – Mixed Source (Annotated)

This document compiles **canon Sword & Sorcery themes**, **merged/overrides**, and **Cyberpunk-origin test themes** into one annotated reference for a tone pass. Canon entries appear first. R&D branches are listed at the end for awareness but are **not** part of canon.

---

## I) Canon – Sword & Sorcery (current live set)

### 1) Post-apocalyptic
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** The world is broken; survival is harsh; ruins are infrastructure.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 2) Brutal
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Life is violent; power is enforced through fear and force; mercy is rare.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 3) Technology as Wonder of the Past
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Relics are rare and mythic; tech is treated like sacred magic; understanding is scarce.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 4) Sorcery as Force of Dread
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Magic is feared—unpredictable, corrupting, and costly; proximity is dangerous.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 5) Civilization is Decadent
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Enclaves rot from within; opulence over rot; politics and vice as survival games.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 6) Cultural Warbands & Walled Loyalties *(merged from “Xenophobia is widespread” + “Fractured Tribal Might”)*
**Status:** Canon (locked, merged v1.1)  
**Summary:** Distinct cultures cling to identity as shield and weapon; trust stops at the walls; warbands as living banners.  
**Cross-links:** [[Gangs – Ethnic Pulpy Archetypes (draft)]] · [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 7) Knowledge is Lost
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** True know‑how is scarce; myths and lies fill the gaps; those who hold knowledge hold power.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 8) The Unknown Surrounds Everything
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** The world beyond known borders is unmapped and unstable; expeditions vanish; maps are rumors.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 9) Heroes are Rare
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Altruism is anomaly; legends are born from single acts; saviors are targeted early.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 10) The Dark is Calling — Black Chitin Beyond *(merged)*
**Status:** Canon (hard‑locked, v1.1)  
**Summary:** A living tide from the Outer Dark presses against failing wards; denial and profiteering mask an inevitable doom.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 11) Relic Minds
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Fractured thinking engines trapped in relics; ancient knowledge with warped agendas; oracles, prizes, and hazards.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

### 12) The Sorcerer Kings *(merged corporate set + savage cultures as their peoples)*
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Ancient rulers whose power flows through guild fronts and mercenary companies; each King’s culture is army, priesthood, and family in one.  
**Cross-links:** [[Gangs – Ethnic Pulpy Archetypes (draft)]] · [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

## II) CyberpunkOrigin – Imported for Stress Test (kept distinct)

> These are tagged `#CyberpunkOrigin` in their source bundle and retained to test cross‑source retrieval. Where a theme is fully merged into canon, the canon entry above supersedes it.

### A) Organized Crime *(Approved candidate)*
**Source:** Cyberpunk theme (kept)  
**Status:** Candidate (approved, not yet canon)  
**Summary:** Syndicates/war‑clans as parallel power; smuggling, ritualized warfare, artifact trafficking; strong visual identities.  
**Cross-links:** [[Gangs – Ethnic Pulpy Archetypes (draft)]] · [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

### B) Relic Minds *(Reframed from “Artificial Intelligence”)*
**Source:** Cyberpunk theme (kept, reframed)  
**Status:** Canon (see Canon #11)  
**Note:** Canon supersedes the import; retained here only for provenance.  
**Cross-links:** [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

### C) Blackwall Dread → **Black Chitin Beyond** *(Merged)*
**Source:** Cyberpunk “Ancient AI / Blackwall” dread  
**Status:** Canon (see Canon #10)  
**Note:** Canon supersedes the import; retained for provenance.  
**Cross-links:** [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

### D) The Sorcerer Kings *(Merged corporate set)*
**Source:** Corporate dominance/guild‑fronts/mercenaries merged  
**Status:** Canon (see Canon #12)  
**Note:** Canon supersedes the import; retained for provenance.  
**Cross-links:** [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

---

## III) R&D Branches (excluded from canon; kept for future merges)

### a) Theme – Street‑Level Survival (branch, pending merge)
**Status:** R&D branch  
**Note:** Kept for possible merge to enrich tone/gameplay hooks around day‑to‑day survival.  
**Cross-links:** [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

### b) Theme – Nomad Barter‑Lords (branch, pending merge)
**Status:** R&D branch  
**Note:** Mobile trade warbands controlling survival via goods flow; potential economy/faction glue.  
**Cross-links:** [[R&D – Cyberpunk Theme Imports (for stress test)]]

### c) Gangs – Ethnic Pulpy Archetypes (draft) *(protected)*
**Status:** R&D protected draft  
**Note:** Visual/role archetypes for culturally distinct war peoples; to be integrated with Sorcerer Kings where appropriate.  
**Cross-links:** [[The Sorcerer Kings]] · [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]]

## Archive / Notes
- Canon reflects **v1.1** merges: *Cultural Warbands & Walled Loyalties* and *Black Chitin Beyond*.  
- CyberpunkOrigin items appear only for stress test provenance; canon entries supersede them.  
- When promoting a candidate to canon, remember to update frontmatter `status:` and add cross‑links to **Ten Foundational Themes**.

## Changelog
- 2025-08-15: Initial mixed‑source annotated compile for tone pass.
