# Theme Compile – Canon-Only Tone Pass

This is a **clean canon-only list** of the Ten Foundational Themes and merged/locked derivatives.  
All Cyberpunk-origin imports and R&D branches have been removed.

---

## Canon Themes

### 1) Post-apocalyptic
**Summary:** The world is broken; survival is harsh; ruins are infrastructure.

### 2) Brutal
**Summary:** Life is violent; power is enforced through fear and force; mercy is rare.

### 3) Technology as Wonder of the Past
**Summary:** Relics are rare and mythic; tech is treated like sacred magic; understanding is scarce.

### 4) Sorcery as Force of Dread
**Summary:** Magic is feared—unpredictable, corrupting, and costly; proximity is dangerous.

### 5) Civilization is Decadent
**Summary:** Enclaves rot from within; opulence over rot; politics and vice as survival games.

### 6) Cultural Warbands & Walled Loyalties
*(merged from “Xenophobia is widespread” + “Fractured Tribal Might”)*  
**Summary:** Distinct cultures cling to identity as shield and weapon; trust stops at the walls; warbands as living banners.

### 7) Knowledge is Lost
**Summary:** True know‑how is scarce; myths and lies fill the gaps; those who hold knowledge hold power.

### 8) The Unknown Surrounds Everything
**Summary:** The world beyond known borders is unmapped and unstable; expeditions vanish; maps are rumors.

### 9) Heroes are Rare
**Summary:** Altruism is anomaly; legends are born from single acts; saviors are targeted early.

### 10) The Dark is Calling — Black Chitin Beyond
*(merged from original “The Dark is Calling” + Cyberpunk-origin “Blackwall Dread”)*  
**Summary:** A living tide from the Outer Dark presses against failing wards; denial and profiteering mask an inevitable doom.

### 11) Relic Minds
**Summary:** Fractured thinking engines trapped in relics; ancient knowledge with warped agendas; oracles, prizes, and hazards.

### 12) The Sorcerer Kings
*(merged corporate set + savage cultures as their peoples)*  
**Summary:** Ancient rulers whose power flows through guild fronts and mercenary companies; each King’s culture is army, priesthood, and family in one.

## Usage Notes
- All entries are canon as of v1.1 merges.
- Cross-links to related notes (ganged archetypes, lore studies) remain in their individual files for context during retrieval.
- This list can be used directly for **tone passes**, **theme checks**, and **setting pitch materials** without noise from R&D or external imports.

## Changelog
