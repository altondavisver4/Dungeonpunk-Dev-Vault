# Mechanics – “Everything is a Monster” OSR Philosophy

**Premise**  
Treat all entities—people, places, factions, ideas—as mechanically addressable "monsters" with stress tracks and aspects.

**Benefits**
- Unified interaction model → fewer bespoke subsystems.
- Enables the [[Procedural – Codex as Quest Generator (concept)]] approach.
- Harmonizes with FATE-PF2E hybrid and OSR sensibilities.

**Interfaces**
- Cross-support with [[Mechanics – FATE–PF2E Hybrid Framework (draft)]].
