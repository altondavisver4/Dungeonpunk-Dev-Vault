# Procedural – Target-Number Narration Across All Rolls

**Premise**  
Every roll emits a standardized narration packet combining: outcome, competence tone, origin point, tone band, and DC label from [[Mechanics – Universal Narrative RNG Doctrine + Roll Interpreter Module (locked)]].

**Usage**
- Works for skill checks, attacks, saves, opposed tests.
- Feeds [[Presentation – Dynamic Text Narration Layer (locked)]] for consistent prose.
