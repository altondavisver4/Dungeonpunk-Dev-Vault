# Procedural – Unified Action Loop

**Purpose**  
Define a single loop structure that governs all player and NPC actions in the game.

**Summary**  
The Unified Action Loop merges OSR exploration pacing with FATE's universal four actions. Every turn, every actor chooses an action that fits the situation, and the system resolves it using the same process regardless of scale or context.

**Steps**  
1. **Perceive** – Gather relevant state/context.  
2. **Choose** – Select one of the four actions (Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend).  
3. **Resolve** – Apply modifiers, roll, narrate results.  
4. **Advance State** – Update stress clocks, move time forward, adjust AI behaviors.
