# Procedural – Unified Action Loop

**Premise**  
Player and AI operate on the same action economy; all actions resolve against clocks/stress.

**Flow**
1. Choose action: **Overcome / Create Advantage / Attack / Defend** (FATE).  
2. Roll via UNRNG → narration packet.  
3. Apply effects to relevant [[Mechanics – Progress Clocks for All Obstacles (draft)]] or stress tracks.  
4. Advance initiative/turn structure (PF2E flavored).

**Notes**
- Time mechanics are pending deeper design; see [[Special – Time Management Lockout for Certain Designs (concept)]] when available.
