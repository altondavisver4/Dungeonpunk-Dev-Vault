# Systems – Zone-Route Terminology Separation

**Purpose**  
Eliminate ambiguity between spatial **Zones** (FATE abstraction for positioning) and progress **Routes/Tracks** (stress/progress).

**Rules**
- Use **Zone** only for spatial partitioning in encounters.
- Use **Stress/Progress** for tracks; **Route** for movement paths if needed.
- Update docs and UI copy to avoid "track" for movement.

**Interfaces**
- Applies across [[Mechanics – FATE–PF2E Hybrid Framework (draft)]] and [[Procedural – Unified Action Loop (draft)]].
