# Systems – Monster/Actor Knowledge Management Sketch

**Goal**  
Sustainably remember entities without blowing up memory or compute.

**Ideas**
- **Encounter biasing:** recently-seen actors get temporarily down-weighted.  
- **Tiered memory:** short-term (encounter), mid-term (session), long-term (faction-level).  
- **Abstract faction memory:** roll-up stats for large groups.  
- **Memory anchors:** special NPCs keep durable records to support ongoing plots.  
- **Soft recycling:** actors retire from tables after arcs conclude.

**Interfaces**
- Consulted by [[Procedural – One Machine Storyteller Engine (draft)]] during selection.
