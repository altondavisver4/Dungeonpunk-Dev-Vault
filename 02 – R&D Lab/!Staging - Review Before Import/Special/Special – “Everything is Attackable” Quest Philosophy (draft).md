# Special – “Everything is Attackable” Quest Philosophy

**Premise**  
Any object, idea, faction, or event can be mechanically addressed using the four FATE actions (Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend).

**Examples**
- Attack **Bandit Infamy** (an aspect/stress target) via propaganda or decisive strikes.
- Overcome **Quarantine Perimeter** through logistics or stealth.
- Create Advantage on **Siege Morale** before the main assault.

**Interfaces**
- Depends on [[Mechanics – “Everything is a Monster” OSR Philosophy (locked)]].
- Extends into [[Procedural – Codex as Quest Generator (concept)]].
