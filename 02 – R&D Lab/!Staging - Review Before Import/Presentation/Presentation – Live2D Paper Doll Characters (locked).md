# Presentation – Live2D Paper Doll Characters

**Premise**  
All NPCs are 2D paper dolls (shared base shapes per gender), animated via Live2D. Complex or off-screen action is described by text narration.

**Guidelines**
- Shared rigs → consistent production pipeline.
- Expression/emote library supports narration tone bands.
- Limit on simultaneous on-screen characters for clarity/performance.

**Interfaces**
- Partners with [[Presentation – Dynamic Text Narration Layer (locked)]].
- Constrains monster sprite counts referenced by [[Mechanics – Encounter Definition – Desire vs. Obstacle (locked)]].
