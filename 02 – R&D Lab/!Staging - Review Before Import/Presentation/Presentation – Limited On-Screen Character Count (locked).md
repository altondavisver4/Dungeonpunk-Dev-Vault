# Presentation – Limited On-Screen Character Count

**Premise**  
Cap the number of simultaneous on-screen actors for performance and readable combat/scene staging.

**Design Notes**
- Emphasize off-screen narration for supporting action.
- Prefer waves/phases over massive crowd scenes.
- Coordinate with tile visibility rules and LOS.

**Interfaces**
- Works with [[Presentation – Dynamic Text Narration Layer (locked)]] to cover off-screen events.
- Impacts group/morale behaviors in [[Special – Group Entities with Morale-Based Disbanding (draft)]] (Wave 4).
