# Presentation – Dynamic Text Narration Layer

**Premise**  
Text describes anything not explicitly rendered: environment states, off-screen actions, micro-combat beats, tone cues.

**Narrative Packets**
- Consumes roll packets from [[Mechanics – Universal Narrative RNG Doctrine + Roll Interpreter Module (locked)]].
- Inlines competence/tone/DC labeling for on-the-fly prose.

**UI Considerations**
- Non-blocking overlay with history and filters (combat log vs. world log).
- Clickable tokens to open related Codex or entity sheets.
