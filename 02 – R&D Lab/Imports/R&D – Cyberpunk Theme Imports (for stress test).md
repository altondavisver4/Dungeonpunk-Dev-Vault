# Cyberpunk→Wasteland Theme Imports (Approved/Merged)

> Purpose: Temporary bundle of the Cyberpunk-derived themes you approved so we can run a mixed-source retrieval compile. Delete after test if desired.

## 1) The Sorcerer Kings
**Origin:** Merged from Corporate Dominance / Corporate Guild-Fronts / Corporate Mercenaries  
**Status:** Canon (merged)  
**Summary:** Ancient, cunning rulers who command cities, guild networks, and mercenary companies; rule sealed in blood and gold. Their people are distinct savage cultures — family, army, and priesthood in one.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]] (entry: *The Sorcerer Kings*)

---

## 2) Organized Crime
**Origin:** Cyberpunk “Organized Crime” → kept
**Status:** Candidate (approved)  
**Summary:** Syndicates and war-clans act as alternative power structures: smuggling, enforced “protection,” artifact trafficking, and ritualized warfare. Visual language and grudges define street-level play.  
**Cross-links:** [[Gangs – Ethnic Pulpy Archetypes (draft)]] · [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]] (entry: *Cultural Warbands & Walled Loyalties*)

---

## 3) Relic Minds
**Origin:** Cyberpunk “Artificial Intelligence” (personal-scale) → reframed
**Status:** Canon (locked)  
**Summary:** Fractured thinking engines trapped in relic devices or shells; remember the old world imperfectly, offer dangerous counsel, and carry agendas.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]] (entry: *Relic Minds*)

---

## 4) The Dark is Calling — Black Chitin Beyond
**Origin:** Cyberpunk “Ancient AI / Blackwall” dread → fused with setting’s apocalyptic Dark
**Status:** Canon (locked, merged)  
**Summary:** A living tide from the Outer Dark held back by failing wards and ruins; everyone profits from denial while the inevitable doom approaches.  
**Cross-links:** [[Lore – Ten Foundational Themes]] (entry: *The Dark is Calling — Black Chitin Beyond*)

## Notes
- Excluded: *Street-Level Survival* and *Nomad Barter-Lords* (both retained as R&D branches for future merges).  
- This bundle exists only to stress-test cross-source retrieval; remove or archive after the compile.

## Changelog
- 2025-08-15: Created from approved/merged Cyberpunk themes for retrieval test.
