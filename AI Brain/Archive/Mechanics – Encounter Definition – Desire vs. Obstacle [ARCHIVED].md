# Mechanics – Encounter Definition – Desire vs. Obstacle

**Definition**  
An encounter is a scene where the **player desires something** and an **obstacle** opposes it. This frames combat, stealth, trade, negotiation, and exploration uniformly.

**Usage**
- Clarifies stakes each scene.  
- Lets One Machine select only scenes with clear push/pull.

**Interfaces**
- Pairs with [[Mechanics – Progress Clocks for All Obstacles (draft)]] for resolution pacing.
- Works with [[Mechanics – Behavior Card System (draft)]] to model opponent actions.
