# Mechanics – “Everything is a Monster” OSR Philosophy

**Purpose**  
Unify all game entities (monsters, NPCs, items, concepts) under a single mechanical framework. Every "thing" in the game is a "monster" with attributes, stress tracks, and behavior cards.

**Summary**  
This approach ensures absolute systemic consistency — combat rules, progress clocks, and interactions apply equally to a political faction, a locked door, or a goblin.  
It simplifies AI-driven narrative generation and allows procedural tools to resolve any conflict or encounter in the same way.

**Core Principles**  
- Every entity has hit points/stress equivalent.  
- Every entity can be targeted by the four FATE actions (Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend).  
- Every entity has aspects and behaviors.  
- All systems, from dialogue to siege warfare, are driven by this universal logic.
