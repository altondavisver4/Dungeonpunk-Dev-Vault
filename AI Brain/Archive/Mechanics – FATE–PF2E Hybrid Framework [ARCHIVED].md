# Mechanics – FATE–PF2E Hybrid Framework

**Blend**
- PF2E math/skills/initiative for crunchy balance.
- FATE's four universal actions: **Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend**.
- Zones for spatial abstraction when gridless scenes make sense.

**Everything is a character**
- Aspects (tags), stress tracks, consequences → align with OSR "everything is a monster".

**Interfaces**
- Supports [[Mechanics – “Everything is a Monster” OSR Philosophy (locked)]].
- Feeds into [[Procedural – Unified Action Loop (draft)]].
