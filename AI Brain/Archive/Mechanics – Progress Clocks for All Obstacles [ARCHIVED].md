# Mechanics – Progress Clocks for All Obstacles

**Purpose**  
Model any obstacle—enemy, trap, negotiation, environmental hazard—as a clock that advances toward resolution.

**Clock interactions**
- FATE actions: Overcome/Attack tick progress or stress.
- Create Advantage adds temporary tags/aspects that modify advance.
- Defend resists opponent clock ticks or stress application.

**Interfaces**
- Consumed by [[Procedural – Unified Action Loop (draft)]].
- Framed by [[Mechanics – Encounter Definition – Desire vs. Obstacle (locked)]].
