# Lore – Fighter Class Interpretation

**Purpose**  
Define the Fighter’s role and meaning within the setting’s culture, warfare, and adventuring traditions.

**Summary**  
Fighters are professional battle pragmatists, forged in the brutal, mixed-technology warfare of the world. They excel at surviving and winning through preparation, discipline, and sheer adaptability.

**Cultural Interpretation**  
- Fighters are anchors of stability in volatile conflicts, trusted to hold the line when others falter.  
- In the (staged) harem-telepathy context, they are valued as physical protectors who give psychics and specialists the time and safety to operate.  
- Viewed as dependable over flashy — the sort of warrior people hire when they want *guaranteed* results.

**Mechanical Role in the World**  
- Ready for combat at any moment; no long recharge times or exotic resources required.  
- Works effectively in any environment, from skirmishes in tight corridors to open-field warfare.  
- Known for consistent performance across varied threats.

**Flavor Hook**  
> A Fighter doesn’t gamble — they stack the odds until losing becomes impossible.

**Interfaces / Cross-links**  
- [[Mechanics – “Everything is a Monster” OSR Philosophy (locked)]]
- [[Procedural – Unified Action Loop (draft)]]
