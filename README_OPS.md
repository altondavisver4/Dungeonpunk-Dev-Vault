# Repository Ops Docs (for the AI Brain)

This folder contains operational documentation and guardrails so **any assistant or person** can maintain the AI Brain without prior chat history.

**Start here:**
- `RUNBOOK.md` — step-by-step operations (daily/weekly), deployments, and "what to do when X fails".
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — how the brain works (sources, indexes, Netlify, GitHub Actions).
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — symptom → cause → fix playbooks.
- `CANON_POLICY.md` — how "Active vs Archived/Deprecated" content is enforced.
- `CANON_STATUS.md` — current canon lists with pointers to replacements.
- `_brain/policy.json` — machine-readable policy for builders/lints.
- `CHANGELOG_AI_BRAIN.md` — log major infra changes so future iterations know what's different.
